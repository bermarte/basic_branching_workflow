# Development_Strategy      
> Group #4  

## Description of the project
* Add the purpose of the project to this file  (dev-strategy&#46;md)

We want to learn how GitHub's basic workflow works, learn how to use **branching** and **pull-requests**. To do this we will simulate how developers collaborate using a version control system like GitHub or Bitbucket. Specifically we need to create a repository where we will create a branch for every student of our group, plus a branch for our teacher. Every branch will have the name of the component of the group. Each branch should contain a mark down file with that specific person's name and a bio for that person written in the mark down file.  Once this is done for every branch, a pull request will be requested to  the Master coming from every branch. The Master will then review and merge all the pull requests.

## Step 0: Create a public repo on GitHub
### Repo
1. Created a new repository on GitHub
1. Clone the repository locally
1. Copy-paste this development strategy file into a file called `development-strategy.md`
1. Give a title to your README
1. Fill out the rest of this file with your team's names
1. Push the changes
1. Turn on GitHub Pages
